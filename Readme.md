# Coding challenges
Here are all source codes hosted, which were finally submitted to the Coding Challenges.

In each folder of the respective Coding Challenge will be an overview of : 
- the team
- the given problem
- boundary conditions of the challenge
- link to the organizer of the Coding Challenge
- the achieved ranking


All coding challenges are taken part for fun, so comments in the code may be superfluous or unusable.
