## The given problem - Photo slideshow

> ### Introduction
> As the saying goes, "a picture is woh a thousand words."
> We agree – photos are an impoant pa of contemporary digital and cultural life. Approximately 2.5 billion 1 people around the world carry a camera – in the form of a smaphone – in their pocket every day. We tend to make good use of it, too, taking more photos than ever (back in 2017, Google Photos announced it was backing up more than 1.2 billion photos and videos per day ). 2 The rise of digital photography creates an interesting challenge: what should we do with all of these photos? In this competition problem, we will explore the idea of composing a slideshow out of a photo collection. 
> ### Task 
> Given a list of photos and the tags associated with each photo, arrange the photos into a slideshow that is as interesting as possible (the scoring section below explains what we mean by “interesting”).
