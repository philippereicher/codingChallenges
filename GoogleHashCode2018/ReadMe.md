## The given problem

> ### Introduction  
> Millions of people commute by car every day; for example, to school or to their workplace. Self-driving vehicles are an
> exciting development for transportation. They aim to make traveling by
> car safer and more available while also saving commuters time. In this
> competition problem, weâ€™ll be looking at how a fleet of self-driving
> vehicles can efficiently get commuters to their destinations in a
> simulated city. 
> ### Task  
> Given a list of pre-booked rides in a city and a fleet of self-driving vehicles, assign the rides to vehicles, so that riders
> get to their destinations on time. For every ride that finishes on
> time (or early), you will earn points proportional to the distance of
> that ride; plus an additional bonus if the ride also started precisely
> on time.
